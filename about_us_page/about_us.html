                        It's been 5 hours without Fortnite, I can’t stop shaking and I’m having severe mental breakdowns. 
                        I woke up today trying to log onto Fortnite but the servers were down, I had a major panic attack but managed to calm down after a few hours. 
                        I am nothing without Fortnite, it is my life, it is my destiny, without Fortnite, I wouldn't be able to do anything.
